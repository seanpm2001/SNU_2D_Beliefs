# Public Domain content

This project uses Public Domain content. Religious texts are free of copyright and are not copyrightable, due to their age (the majority of them being over 400 years old) and their content type, as Religion cannot be copyrighted.

I finally got a hold of a copy of a Christian Bible on April 5th 2021, and uploaded it here as a reference. It is not eligable for copyright, as it came out in the year 1611 (the copyright expired at least 220 years ago worldwide as of April 5th 2021)

I am not profiting off this content. Sponsors are sponsoring the source code and other aspects of the project.
