# `CONTRIBUTING.md`

I am accepting contributions at the moment. The current things I am looking for are:

> * Improvements for home page designs

> * Translations from English to various languages (DO NOT USE A TRANSLATION SERVICE FOR THIS, SUCH AS Google Translate, Bing Translate, DeepL, etc. I want people who actually speak the language to help translate) 

> * Graphical improvements

Just send them as a request, I will try to make as many things as possible work. Remember to follow the guidelines of this part of the site (no hate symbols such as 卐 or 卍, ☭, etc. I can use swastikas as parts of religion, as they were originally innocent and from ancient Asian languages, but I can't accept usage from 1933 AD and afterwards. HATE SPEECH IS NOT ALLOWED | NUDITY/GORE IS NOT ALLOWED)
