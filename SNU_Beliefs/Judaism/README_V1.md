This is the section of the SNU Beliefs GigaSynagogue that allows the safe discussion of Judaism. Filters are hard at play to make sure it is a safe and comfortable environment for all Jews.

The Holocaust is not banned from discussion, but safe guards are put in place to prevent pro-Holocaust speech. Users can hide these posts if they like. The Holocaust should not be repeated, and it definitely should not be denied. 

Resources, such as [the Tanakh](/SNU_Beliefs/Judaism/Tanakh/README.md) are available here for reading, reference, and download.
