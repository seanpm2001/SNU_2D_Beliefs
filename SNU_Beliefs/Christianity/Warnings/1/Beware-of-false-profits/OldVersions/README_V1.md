# Beware of false profits

If you read the bible, it warns you of false prophets (people who claim to be a messenger or 2nd coming of Christ) these are the people the bible warns about. According to the bible, they are the anti-Christ, or the anti-Christs henchmen.

Televangelists and megachurch pastors (such as Joel Olsteen) commonly are false prophets, and they are profiting off of the religion, which is something the opposite of what Jesus Christ did, meaning they are anti-Christ.

This quote will explain it better:

"Someone needs to say this plainly: The faith healers and health-and-wealth preachers who dominate religious television are shameless frauds. Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy."
