# Milestone 3 Version 7 Alpha 1.0 build

This is a milestone 3 version 7 Alpha 1 build of the SNU 2D beliefs center. This is just a clone of the local version, with an included Wiki, extra `IGNORE.md` files, and 1 change (1 file is different, which is the absence of the Tanakh, and a mojibaked version in its place)

The current religions are:

> * Buddhist
> * Catholicism
> * Christianity
> * Hinduism
> * Islam
> * Judaism
> * Mormonism
> * Norse (old, and mythology)

The current irreligions are:

> * Agnosticism
> * Atheism

This version is not ready to be in distributions yet, as the pages are highly incomplete, and there is no upload support (work for that will begin with the first SNU beta build)
