### Fix the Agnosticism spelling error and update Agnosticism

Early on with development, I made a severe spelling error when adding support for Agnosticism, as I didn't look up what it was actually called. So older entries list the irreligion as `Nongelism` which is not the correct word, but something my mind generated when the correct word was not in memory.

This error needs to be fixed, and along with this, it should be updated to fit modern standards for HTML document work.
